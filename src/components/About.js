    <p>
      Hi! I am Dino Quispe, and I am a full-stack web developer with an electronic
      engineer’s degree who is enthusiastic about technology. I am currently
      completing coursework at Microverse, where I’m learning every day to code
      real projects in remote pair programming with other developers around the world,
      and have improved my skills in communication, teamwork, work ethics,
      and work with deadlines.
